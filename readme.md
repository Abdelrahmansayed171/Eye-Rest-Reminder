# Eye Health Timer

## Motivation

#### Spending a lot of time staring at a screen can make your eyes tired and uncomfortable. To help with this, doctors suggest taking a short break of about one minute for every 20 minutes you spend looking at a computer. This app helps you remember to take those breaks by giving you a reminder every 20 minutes.

## Features

- **20-Minute Timer**: Automatically counts down from 20 minutes.
- **Alarm Notification**: Plays an alarm sound when the timer reaches zero.
- **Acknowledgment GUI**: A popup window appears with an option to stop the alarm.
- **Timer Reset**: After you acknowledge the alarm, timer resets after 5 mins break.


## App Display

- **Transparent and Overlay Window**: The timer window has a semi-transparent black background and stays on top of other applications.
- **Drag and Move**: You can drag and reposition the window anywhere on the screen.
- **Button Visibility on Hover**: Close and minimize buttons appear when you hover over the window.
- **Minimize Window**: The window can be minimized to the taskbar.
- **Timer Display**: Shows the countdown in a large, clear format.
- **Close and Minimize Buttons**: Appear when you hover over the window and allow you to close or minimize the application.
